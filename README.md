📊 **Key Findings:**  
- Cohort churn stabilizes at ~90% after 2-3 years, indicating a predictable long-term retention pattern.  
- Retention rates are consistently low (8-10%) across all cohorts, suggesting retention issues are systemic rather than specific to certain years.  
- Newer cohorts (2022-2023) show similar churn trajectories, signaling that without intervention, future cohorts will follow the same pattern.  

💡 **Business Insights:**  
- Strengthen early engagement strategies to target the first 1-2 years with onboarding incentives, loyalty rewards, and personalized offers to improve long-term retention.  
- Re-engage high-value churned customers by focusing on targeted win-back campaigns rather than broad retention efforts, as reactivating valuable users may yield higher ROI.  
- Predict & preempt churn risk and use customer-specific warning indicators to proactively intervene with at-risk users before they lapse.
